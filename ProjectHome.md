# Open Source IC Layout Editor #
This is a ground zero for the project in terms of source code development, documentation and bug tracking. The latest release packets, code snapshots, as well as current development activities and issues shall be found here.

### The goal ###
A fast and reliable EDA tool accessible for every IC design company or a single designer at work or at home.

### General areas of development ###
  * handling of layout databases with a gigabyte size and beyond
  * fast and precise graphic rendering
  * parsing (syntactic analysis) and interpretation
  * combinatorial computational geometry
  * cross platform programming & multithreading

### A bit of history ###
The project begun years ago with some initial ideas about fast rendering and full custom layout scripting. It had been exported to the public space in October 2005 (I wish I did that much earlier). In September 2006 release 0.8 became officially a part of Fedora extras repository. Since August 2009 the project is hosted on googlecode.
